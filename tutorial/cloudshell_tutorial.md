# Getting Started with Terraform on Google Cloud Platform

## Introduction

### About this guide

This guide will help you quickly learn the fundamentals of Terraform and using
it to provision infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

As you follow this guide, you'll use Terraform to provision, update, and destroy
a simple set of infrastructure using the sample configuration provided.

The sample configuration provisions a resource group, networking resources and
rules, storage, and a basic Linux virtual machine. You'll also learn about
Terraform modules, remote backends, outputs, and provisioners. These are the
building blocks for more complex configurations.

### Google Cloud Shell

This guide uses Google Cloud Shell to give you an environment preconfigured with Terraform. You can run commands at the command prompt, and edit the files in the editor window.

If you'd prefer to follow this tutorial on your local machine, you can follow [this guide on learn.hashicorp.com](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/gcp/intro).

## Installing Terraform

Terraform is already install in your Cloud Shell environment. You can verify this by running:

```bash
terraform --version
```

If you'd like to install Terraform on your local machine, you can [follow the instructions here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/gcp/install).

### Note: Terraform versions

When running the previous command, you may see a warning that there is a newer version of Terraform available. This guide has been tested with the version of Terraform installed in your Cloud Shell environment, so please continue to use it for the rest of the guide.

## Setting Up

With Terraform installed, let's dive right into it and start creating some
infrastructure.

We'll build infrastructure on [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) for this getting
started guide, but Terraform can manage many other things using
[providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html). Some examples
of this are in the [use cases
section](https://www.terraform.io/intro/use-cases.html).

### Warning: Cost

While everything provisioned in this guide should fall within GCP's free tier, if you provision resources outside of the free tier, you may be charged. We cannot be responsible for any charges you may incur.

### Setting up GCP

Create or select the project you'd like to use throughout this tutorial below.

#### Authentication

When we're using Google Cloud Shell, the shell is already configured with access
to your GCP credentials, so you won't need to do anything extra to authenticate
and start provisioning resources. When using Terraform from another environment,
you'll need to configure authentication. You can [read about credentials
here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_reference.html#credentials).

## Terraform Configuration

The set of files used to describe infrastructure in Terraform is known as a
Terraform _configuration_. We're going to write our first configuration now to
launch a single GCP instance.

The format of the configuration files is [documented
here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html). Configuration
files can [also be
JSON](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html), but we recommend
only using JSON when the configuration is generated by a machine.

The entire configuration is shown below. We'll go over each part soon.

When run, Terraform will load all configuration files from the current directory. So it's a good idea to have a separate directory for each project. Your Cloud Shell environment should include a directory called `tutorial` that will store the configuration we'll use for this guide.

Inside of it there should be a file named `main.tf`. Terraform recognizes files ending in `.tf` or `.tf.json` as configuration files and will load them when it runs.

First, we'll configure the provider. Add the following to `main.tf`:

```hcl
provider "google" {
  project = "<PROJECT_ID>"
  region  = "us-central1"
  zone    = "us-central1-c"
}
```

You'll need to replace the project with the project id of the project you created earlier. Remember you can see a list of your projects in the [cloud resource manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager)

The `provider` block is used to configure the named provider, in
our case `google`. A provider is responsible for creating and
managing resources. Multiple provider blocks can exist if a
Terraform configuration manages resources from different providers.

### Initialization

The first command to run for a new configuration -- or after checking out an
existing configuration from version control -- is `terraform init`, which
initializes various local settings and data that will be used by subsequent
commands.

Run the command `terraform init` in the same directory as your main.tf file now:

```bash
$ terraform init
```

```raw
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "google" (terraform-providers/google) 2.10.0...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.google: version = "~> 2.10"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

The `google` provider plugin has been downloaded and installed in a subdirectory
of the current working directory, along with various other book-keeping files.

The output specifies which version of the plugin was installed, and suggests
specifying that version in configuration to ensure that running `terraform init`
in future will install a compatible version. This step is not necessary to
follow this getting started guide, since we'll discard this configuration at the
end.

## Applying Configuration

The `init` command doesn't actually provision any resources, it just sets up
your working directory to use the provider configuration you supplied. Before we can

### Enabling Services

In this guide, we'll be using the Google Compute Engine, and we'll also need to
enable the "OS Login" service for authentication. We need to enable these
services before we can use them. To do so, we'll also introduce our first
_resource_. You can learn more about how this resource works from [the
documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/google_project_services.html).

Add the following to your main.tf file:

```hcl
resource "google_project_services" "project_services" {
  project  = "{{project-id}}"
  services = ["compute.googleapis.com", "oslogin.googleapis.com"]
}
```

The `resource` block defines a resource that exists within your infrastructure.
A resource might be a physical or virtual component such as a server, or a
logical resource such as a Google App Engine application, or configuration,
which is what this one is. It will enable the listed services for your project.

To apply your changes, run `terraform apply`.

You should see output like this:
```raw
$ terraform apply
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
Terraform will perform the following actions:
  # google_project_services.project_services will be created
  + resource "google_project_services" "project_services" {
      + disable_on_destroy = true
      + id                 = (known after apply)
      + project            = "just-center-247116"
      + services           = [
          + "compute.googleapis.com",
        ]
    }
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
  Enter a value:
```

Respond with `yes`. When you do, you should see further output like this:

```raw
...
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
  Enter a value: yes
google_project_services.project_services: Creating...
google_project_services.project_services: Creation complete after 7s [id=just-center-247116]
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Adding this resource is the equivalent of navigating to the appropriate page in
the [api
library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/compute.googleapis.com)
and enabling the services there.

You may also have noticed that we have to repeat the project ID. Don't worry, we'll fix that soon when we learn about _variables_.

## Provisioning Resources

Now we'll create our first "real" resource: A Virtual Private Cloud network. Add
the following to your `main.tf` file:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name = "terraform-network"
  depends_on = [google_project_services.project_services]  
}
```

This is an example of a more common use for resources. We'll use this network
for resources we create later in this guide.

The resource block has two strings before opening the block: the resource type
and the resource name. In our example, the resource type is
"google_compute_network" and the name is "vpc_network." The prefix of the type
maps to the provider. In our case "google_compute_network" automatically tells
Terraform that it is managed by the "google" provider. The resource type and
name together form the resource ID, in this case
"google_compute_network.vpc_network". The resource can be referenced by this ID
in other parts of your configuration.

Within the resource block itself is configuration for that resource. This is
dependent on each resource provider and is fully documented within our
[providers reference](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html).

The [GCP provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html)
documents supported resources resources, including
[google_compute_network](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_network.html).

There are a number of optional arguments, but for our network, we just specify
the name, which will be how the network is identified in GCP.

### Creating Resources

Run `terraform apply` again. You should see output similar to this:

```raw
...
Terraform will perform the following actions:
  # google_compute_network.vpc_network will be created
  + resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
      + auto_create_subnetworks         = true
      + delete_default_routes_on_create = false
      + gateway_ipv4                    = (known after apply)
      + id                              = (known after apply)
      + name                            = "terraform-network"
      + project                         = (known after apply)
      + routing_mode                    = (known after apply)
      + self_link                       = (known after apply)
    }
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
...
```

This output shows the _execution plan_, describing which actions Terraform will
take in order to create infrastructure to match the configuration. The output
format is similar to the diff format generated by tools such as Git. The output
has a `+` next to `resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network"`, meaning
that Terraform will create this resource. Beneath that, it shows the attributes
that will be set. When the value displayed is `(known after apply)`, it means
that the value won't be known until the resource is created.

If the plan was created successfully, Terraform will now pause and wait for
approval before proceeding. If anything in the plan seems incorrect or
dangerous, it is safe to abort here with no changes made to your infrastructure.

In this case the plan looks acceptable, so type `yes` at the confirmation prompt
to proceed.

Executing the plan will take a few minutes since Terraform waits for the network
to be created successfully:

```raw
# ...
  Enter a value: yes

google_compute_network.vpc_network: Creating...
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still creating... [40s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still creating... [50s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Creation complete after 58s [id=terraform-network]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

After this, Terraform is all done! You can go to the GCP console to see the
network you created. Make sure you're looking at the same region and project
that was configured in the provider configuration.

If you look in your current working directory, you'll see that Terraform also
wrote some data into the `terraform.tfstate` file. This state file is extremely
important; it keeps track of Terraform's understanding of the resources it
created. We recommended that you use source control for the configuration files,
but the state should not be stored in source control. You can [setup remote
state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html) to store and share the
state with your teams. You'll see how to do so later on in this guide.

## Inspecting State

You can inspect the current state by running `terraform show`:

```raw
$ terraform show
# google_compute_network.vpc_network:
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
    auto_create_subnetworks         = true
    delete_default_routes_on_create = false
    id                              = "terraform-network"
    name                            = "terraform-network"
    project                         = "just-center-247116"
    routing_mode                    = "REGIONAL"
    self_link                       = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/just-center-247116/global/networks/terraform-network"
}
# google_project_services.project_services:
resource "google_project_services" "project_services" {
    disable_on_destroy = true
    id                 = "just-center-247116"
    project            = "just-center-247116"
    services           = [
        "compute.googleapis.com",
        "oslogin.googleapis.com",
    ]
}
```

You can see that by creating our resource, we've also gathered a lot of
information about it. These values can be referenced to configure other
resources or outputs, which will be covered later in this guide.

## Changing Infrastructure

In the previous section, you created your first infrastructure with Terraform: a
VPC network. In this section, we're going to modify your configuration, and see
how Terraform handles change.

Infrastructure is continuously evolving, and Terraform was built to help manage
and enact that change. As you change Terraform configurations, Terraform builds
an execution plan that only modifies what is necessary to reach your desired
state.

By using Terraform to change infrastructure, you can version control not only
your configurations but also your state, so you can see how the infrastructure
evolves over time.

### Adding Resources

We can add resources to our configuration. We'll create a compute instance by
adding the following to `main.tf`:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "terraform-instance"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
    }
  }

  network_interface {
    network = google_compute_network.vpc_network.name
    access_config {
    }
  }
}
```

We're setting a few more arguments this time. The name and machine type are
simple strings, but `boot_disk` and `network_interface` are more complex blocks.
You can see all of the available options [in the
documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_instance.html).
For this example, we'll use a Debian operating system, and the VPC Network we
created earlier. Notice how we refer to the network's name property with
`google_compute_network.vpc_network.name` --
`google_compute_network.vpc_network` is the ID, matching the values in the block
that defines the network, and `name` is a property of that resource.

The presence of the `access_config` block, even without any arguments, ensures
that the instance will be accessible over the internet.

We can now apply that change:

```raw
$ terraform apply
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be created
  + resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
      + can_ip_forward       = false
      + cpu_platform         = (known after apply)
      + deletion_protection  = false
      + guest_accelerator    = (known after apply)
      + id                   = (known after apply)
      + instance_id          = (known after apply)
      + label_fingerprint    = (known after apply)
      + machine_type         = "f1-micro"
      + metadata_fingerprint = (known after apply)
      + name                 = "terraform-instance"
      + project              = (known after apply)
      + self_link            = (known after apply)
      + tags_fingerprint     = (known after apply)
      + zone                 = (known after apply)

      + boot_disk {
          + auto_delete                = true
          + device_name                = (known after apply)
          + disk_encryption_key_sha256 = (known after apply)
          + source                     = (known after apply)

          + initialize_params {
              + image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
              + size  = (known after apply)
              + type  = (known after apply)
            }
        }

      + network_interface {
          + address            = (known after apply)
          + name               = (known after apply)
          + network            = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/hc-training-test/global/networks/terraform-network"
          + network_ip         = (known after apply)
          + subnetwork         = (known after apply)
          + subnetwork_project = (known after apply)

          + access_config {
              + assigned_nat_ip = (known after apply)
              + nat_ip          = (known after apply)
              + network_tier    = (known after apply)
            }
        }

      + scheduling {
          + automatic_restart   = (known after apply)
          + on_host_maintenance = (known after apply)
          + preemptible         = (known after apply)

          + node_affinities {
              + key      = (known after apply)
              + operator = (known after apply)
              + values   = (known after apply)
            }
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Creating...
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still creating... [40s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Creation complete after 41s [id=terraform-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Once again, answer `yes` to the confirmation prompt.

This is a fairly straightforward change - we added a "google_compute_instance"
resource named "vm_instance" to our configuration, and Terraform created the
resource in GCP.

## Changing Resources

Adding new resources is one thing. Terraform also supports changing resources.
Add a "tags" argument to your "vm_instance" so that it looks like this:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "terraform-instance"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"
  tags         = ["web", "dev"]

# ...
```

Run `terraform apply` again. You should see output like this:

```raw
$ terraform apply
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

...

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {

...

~ tags                 = [
    + "dev",
    + "web",
  ]

...

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:
```

The prefix `~` means that Terraform will update the resource in-place. You can
go and and apply this change now by responding `yes`, and Terraform will add the
tags to your instance.

## Destructive Changes

Let's change the disk image of our instance. Edit the `boot_disk` block inside
your `vm_instance` resource your configuration file and change it to the
following:

```hcl
  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "cos-cloud/cos-stable"
    }
  }
```

We've changed the boot disk from being a Debian 9 image to use Google's
Container-Optimized OS. After editing the configuration, run `terraform apply`
again to see how Terraform will apply this change to the existing resources.

```raw
$ terraform apply
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance must be replaced
-/+ resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {

          ~ subnetwork_project = "hc-training-test" -> (known after apply)

          ~ access_config {
              + assigned_nat_ip = (known after apply)
              ~ nat_ip          = "34.66.211.126" -> (known after apply)
              ~ network_tier    = "PREMIUM" -> (known after apply)
            }
        }

      ~ scheduling {
          ~ automatic_restart   = true -> (known after apply)
          ~ on_host_maintenance = "MIGRATE" -> (known after apply)
          ~ preemptible         = false -> (known after apply)

          + node_affinities {
              + key      = (known after apply)
              + operator = (known after apply)
              + values   = (known after apply)
            }
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:
```

The prefix `-/+` means that Terraform will destroy and recreate the resource,
rather than updating it in-place. While some attributes can be updated in-place
(which are shown with the `~` prefix), changing the boot disk image for a VM
instance requires recreating it. Terraform and the GCP provider handle these
details for you, and the execution plan makes it clear what Terraform will do.

Additionally, the execution plan shows that the disk image change is what
required our instance to be replaced. Using this information, you can adjust
your changes to possibly avoid destroy/create updates if they are not acceptable
in some situations.

Once again, Terraform prompts for approval of the execution plan before
proceeding. Answer `yes` to execute the planned steps:

```raw
  Enter a value: yes

google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Destroying... [id=terraform-instance]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 10s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 20s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 30s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 40s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 50s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Destruction complete after 57s
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Creating...
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Creation complete after 29s [id=terraform-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
```

As indicated by the execution plan, Terraform first destroyed the existing
instance and then created a new one in its place. You can use `terraform show`
again to see the new values associated with this instance.

## Destroying Infrastructure

We've now seen how to build and change infrastructure. Before we move on to
creating multiple resources and showing resource dependencies, we're going to go
over how to completely destroy your Terraform-managed infrastructure.

Destroying your infrastructure is a rare event in production environments. But
if you're using Terraform to spin up multiple environments such as development,
test, and QA, then destroying is often a useful action.

### Terraform Destroy

Resources can be destroyed using the `terraform destroy` command, which is
similar to `terraform apply` but it behaves as if all of the resources have been
removed from the configuration.

```raw
$ terraform destroy
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be destroyed
  - resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
      - can_ip_forward       = false -> null
      - cpu_platform         = "Intel Haswell" -> null
      - deletion_protection  = false -> null
...

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value:
```

The `-` prefix indicates that the instance and the network will be destroyed. As
with apply, Terraform shows its execution plan and waits for approval before
making any changes.

Answer `yes` to execute this plan and destroy the infrastructure:

```raw
Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Destroying... [id=terraform-instance]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 10s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 20s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 30s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 40s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 50s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 1m0s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Destruction complete after 1m04s
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Destroying... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 10s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 20s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 30s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 40s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 50s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 1m0s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 1m10s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Destruction complete after 1m17s

Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
```

Just like with `apply`, Terraform determines the order in which things must be
destroyed. GCP won't allow a VPC network to be deleted if there are resources
still in it, so Terraform waits until the instance is destroyed before
destroying the network. When performing operations, Terraform creates a
dependency graph to determine the correct order of operations. In more
complicated cases with multiple resources, Terraform will perform operations in
parallel when it's safe to do so.

## Resource Dependancies

In this section, we're going to learn more about resource dependencies and how to
use resource parameters to share information about one resource with other
resources.

Real-world infrastructure has a diverse set of resources and resource types.
Terraform configurations can contain multiple resources, multiple resource
types, and these types can even span multiple providers.

On this page, we'll show a basic example of how to configure multiple resources
and how to reference the attributes of other resources to configure other
resources.

If you've been following this guide, you destroyed your resources in the last
step, and so `terraform show` will show no resources:

```raw
$ terraform show

```

Go ahead and recreate your network and instance by running `terraform apply`:

```raw
$ terraform apply

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be created
  + resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
      + can_ip_forward       = false
...

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
...
Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

It's possible you might see an error like this one:

```raw
Error: Error authoritatively enabling Project PROJECT_ID Services: unable to enable Project Services PROJECT_ID ([oslogin.googl
eapis.com compute.googleapis.com]): Batch "project/PROJECT_ID/services:batchEnable" for request "Enable Project Services PROJECT_ID: [oslogin.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com]" returned error: Error waiting for Enable Project "PROJECT_ID" Services: [oslo
gin.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com]: Error code 9, message: [The service is currently being deactivated and deactivation must comp
lete before activation can occur.] with failed services [compute.googleapis.com]
```

As the error says, in this case it took a few minutes for the service to be disabled, and the GCP API won't allow us to activate it while this is still going on. If this happens to you, you'll need to wait a few minutes and re-run `terraform apply`.

### Assigning an Elastic IP

Now we'll improve your configuration by assigning a static IP to the VM instance
we're managing. Modify your `main.tf` and add the following:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_address" "vm_static_ip" {
  name = "terraform-static-ip"
}
```

This should look familiar from the earlier example of adding a VM instance
resource, except this time we're creating an "google_compute_address" resource
type. This resource type allocates a [reserved IP
address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/#reservedaddress) to
your project.

You can see what will be created with `terraform plan`:

```raw
$ terraform plan
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_address.vm_static_ip will be created
  + resource "google_compute_address" "vm_static_ip" {
      + address            = (known after apply)
      + address_type       = "EXTERNAL"
      + creation_timestamp = (known after apply)
      + id                 = (known after apply)
      + name               = "terraform-static-ip"
      + network_tier       = (known after apply)
      + project            = (known after apply)
      + region             = (known after apply)
      + self_link          = (known after apply)
      + subnetwork         = (known after apply)
      + users              = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
```

Unlike `terraform apply`, the _plan_ command will only show what would be
changed, and never actually apply the changes directly. Notice that the only
change we're making is to add a static IP. What we want is to attach the IP
address to your instance.

Update the `network_interface` configuration for your instance like so:

```hcl
  network_interface {
    network = google_compute_network.vpc_network.self_link
    access_config {
      nat_ip = google_compute_address.vm_static_ip.address
    }
  }
```

The
[access_config](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_instance.html#access_config)
block has several optional arguments, and in this case we'll set `nat_ip` to be
the static IP address. When Terraform reads this configuration, it will:

1. Ensure that `vm_static_ip` is created before `vm_instance`
1. Save the properties of `vm_static_ip` in the state
1. Set `nat_ip` to the value of the `vm_static_ip.address` property

### Plan Changes

We'll run `terraform plan` again, but this time, let's save the plan:

```raw
$ terraform plan -out static_ip
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_address.vm_static_ip will be created
  + resource "google_compute_address" "vm_static_ip" {
      + address            = (known after apply)
      + address_type       = "EXTERNAL"
...

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
        can_ip_forward       = false
        cpu_platform         = "Intel Haswell"
        deletion_protection  = false
...
          ~ access_config {
              ~ nat_ip       = "34.66.211.126" -> (known after apply)
                network_tier = "PREMIUM"
...
Plan: 1 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This plan was saved to: static_ip

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "static_ip"
```

Saving the plan this way ensures that we can apply exactly the same plan in the
future. If we try to apply the file created by the plan, Terraform will first
check to make sure the exact same set of changes will be made before applying
the plan.

In this case, we can see that Terraform will create a new
`google_compute_address` and update the existing VM to use it.

### Apply Changes

Run `terraform apply "static_ip"` to see how Terraform plans to apply this change.
The output will look similar to the following:

```raw
$ terraform apply "static_ip"
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Creating...
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Creation complete after 5s [id=hc-training-test/us-central1/terraform-static-ip]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Modifying... [id=terraform-instance]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still modifying... [id=terraform-instance, 10s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still modifying... [id=terraform-instance, 20s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Modifications complete after 28s [id=terraform-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.

The state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path
below. This state is required to modify and destroy your
infrastructure, so keep it safe. To inspect the complete state
use the `terraform show` command.

State path: terraform.tfstate
```

As shown above, Terraform created the static IP before modifying the VM
instance. Due to the interpolation expression that passes the IP address to the
instance's network interface configuration, Terraform is able to infer a
dependency, and knows it must create the static IP before updating the instance.

## Implicit and Explicit Dependencies

By studying the resource attributes used in interpolation expressions, Terraform
can automatically infer when one resource depends on another. In the example
above, the reference to `google_compute_address.vm_static_ip.address` creates an
_implicit dependency_ on the `google_compute_address` named `vm_static_ip`.

Terraform uses this dependency information to determine the correct order in
which to create and update different resources. In the example above, Terraform
knows that the `vm_static_ip` must be created before the `vm_instance` is
updated to use it.

Implicit dependencies via interpolation expressions are the primary way
to inform Terraform about these relationships, and should be used whenever
possible.

Sometimes there are dependencies between resources that are _not_ visible to
Terraform. The `depends_on` argument is accepted by any resource and accepts
a list of resources to create _explicit dependencies_ for.

For example, when we created the vpc_network, we added an explicit dependency on the project services we enabled:

```
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name = "terraform-network"
  depends_on = [google_project_services.project_services]  
}
```

This dependency ensures that the network will be created only after the project
services are enabled, and that the project services won't be disabled until
after the network is destroyed. There isn't an implicit dependency on these two
resources, since there's no direct connection in the GCP API between the network
on the services we enabled.

## Provisioning

The compute instance we launched at this point is based on the Google image
given, but has no additional software installed or configuration applied.

GCP allows customers to manage their own [custom operating system images
](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/create-delete-deprecate-private-images).
This can be a great way to ensure the instances you provision with Terraform are
pre-configured based on your needs. [Packer](https://www.packer.io) is the
perfect tool for this and includes a [builder for
GCP](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/googlecompute.html).

In general, we recommend that you use a tool like Packer so that your
infrastructure requires little or no provisioning after it's deployed. Managing
your infrastructure this way is sometimes called _immutable infrastructure_, and can help ensure your infrastructure is more robust and fault tolerant.

That said, many infrastructures still require some sort of initialization or
software provisioning step. Terraform uses _provisioners_ to upload files, run
shell scripts, or install and trigger other software like configuration
management tools.

### Defining a Provisioner

To define a provisioner, modify the resource block defining the `vm_instance` to
look like the following:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "terraform-instance"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"
  tags         = ["web", "dev"]

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${google_compute_instance.vm_instance.name}:  ${google_compute_instance.vm_instance.network_interface[0].access_config[0].nat_ip} >> ip_address.txt"
  }

# ...
```

This adds a `provisioner` block within the `resource` block. Multiple
`provisioner` blocks can be added to define multiple provisioning steps.
Terraform supports [many
provisioners](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html), but for
this example we are using the `local-exec` provisioner.

The `local-exec` provisioner executes a command locally on the machine running
Terraform, not the VM instance itself. We're using this provisioner versus the
others so we don't have to worry about specifying any [connection
info](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/connection.html) right now.

This also shows a more complex example of string interpolation than we've seen
before. Each VM instance can have multiple network interfaces, so we refer to
the first one with `network_interface[0]` - counting starting from 0, as most
programming languages do. Each network interface can have multiple access_config
blocks as well, so once again we specify the first one.

### Running Provisioners

The results of running `terraform apply` at this point may be confusing at
first:

```raw
$ terraform apply
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Refreshing state... [id=hc-training-test/us-central1/terraform-static-ip]
google_storage_bucket.example_bucket: Refreshing state... [id=example-bucket-robin-jul-9-2019]
google_compute_instance.another_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance-2]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Terraform found nothing to do - and if you check, you'll find that there's no
`ip_address.txt` file on the cloud shell filesystem.

Terraform treats provisioners differently from other properties. Provisioners
only run when a resource is created, but adding a provisioner does not force
that resource to be destroyed and recreated. If this is what we want, we can use
`terraform taint` to tell Terraform to recreate the instance. Run the command
`terraform taint google_compute_instance.vm_instance` now:

```raw
$ terraform taint google_compute_instance.vm_instance
Resource instance google_compute_instance.vm_instance has been marked as tainted.
```

A _tainted_ resource will be destroyed and recreated during the next _apply_.
Run `terraform apply` now:

```raw
$ terraform apply
# ...

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance is tainted, so must be replaced
-/+ resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {

# ...

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

# ...

google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Provisioning with 'local-exec'...
google_compute_instance.vm_instance (local-exec): Executing: ["/bin/sh" "-c" "echo 104.154.236.90 > ip_address.txt"]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Creation complete after 52s [id=terraform-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
```

You can verify everything worked by looking at the `ip_address.txt` file:

```raw
$ cat ip_address.txt
terraform-instance: 35.194.46.141
```

It contains the IP, just as we asked!

### Failed Provisioners and Tainted Resources

If a resource is successfully created but fails a provisioning step, Terraform
will error and mark the resource as _tainted_. A resource that is tainted still
exists, but can't be considered safe to use since provisioning failed.

When you generate your next execution plan, Terraform will remove any tainted
resources and create new resources, attempting to provision them again after
creation.

### Destroy Provisioners

Provisioners can also be defined that run only during a destroy
operation. These are useful for performing system cleanup, extracting
data, etc.

For many resources, using built-in cleanup mechanisms is recommended
if possible (such as init scripts), but provisioners can be used if
necessary.

The getting started guide won't show any destroy provisioner examples.
If you need to use destroy provisioners, please
[see the provisioner documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners).

## Variables

You now have enough Terraform knowledge to create useful configurations, but
we're still hard-coding our project name, zone, etc. To become truly shareable
and version controlled, we need to parameterize the configurations. This page
introduces input variables as a way to do this.

### Defining Variables

Let's first extract a few of the hardcoded values into variables.

Edit the file called `variables.tf` to add the following contents:

```hcl
variable "project" { }

variable "region" {
  default = "us-central1"
}

variable "zone" {
  default = "us-central1-c"
}
```

#### Note

Terraform loads all files ending in `.tf` in a directory, so it doesn't matter
to terraform where your variables are defined. We recommend defining them in
their own file to make your configuration easier to organize and understand.

This defines three variables within your Terraform configuration. The first one
has an empty block: `{ }`. The other two set defaults. If a default value is
set, the variable is optional. Otherwise, the variable is required. If you run
`terraform plan` now, Terraform will prompt you for the value of the _region_
variable.

### Using Variables in Configuration

Next, update the GCP provider configuration in `main.tf` with the following:

```hcl
provider "google" {
  project = var.project
  region  = var.region
  zone    = var.zone
}
```

Variables are referenced with the `var.` prefix.

### Assigning Variables

There are several ways to assign variables, depending on your needs.

#### Command-line flags

You can set variables directly on the command-line with the `-var` flag. Any
command in Terraform that inspects the configuration accepts this flag, such as
`apply`, `plan`, and `refresh`:

```raw
$ terraform plan -var 'project=<PROJECT_ID>'

...
```

Setting variables this way will not save them, and they'll have to be passed
this way every time you run terraform.

#### From a file

To persist variable values, create a file and assign variables within
this file. Edit the file named `terraform.tfvars` with the following
contents:

```hcl
project = "<PROJECT_ID>"
```

Be sure to replace `<PROJECT_ID>` with your project's ID.

Terraform automatically loads all files which match `terraform.tfvars` or
`*.auto.tfvars` present in the current directory to populate variables. You can
also specify a file to load with the `-var-file` commandline argument.

These files are the same syntax as Terraform configuration files.

For security reasons, we recommend never saving usernames and passwords to
version control. Your terraform configuration will probably need these secret
values, though. One solution is to create a local secret variables file and use
`-var-file` to load it.

You can also use multiple `-var-file` arguments in a single command, with some
checked in to version control and others not checked in. For example:

```raw
$ terraform apply \
  -var-file="secret.tfvars" \
  -var-file="production.tfvars"
```

#### From environment variables

Terraform will read environment variables in the form of `TF_VAR_name`
to find the value for a variable. For example, the `TF_VAR_region`
environment variable can be set to set the `region` terraform variable.

**Note**: Environment variables can only populate string-type variables.
List and map type variables must be populated via one of the other mechanisms.

#### UI Input

If you execute `terraform apply` with some variables unspecified, Terraform will
ask you to input their values interactively. These values are not saved, but
this provides a convenient workflow when getting started with Terraform. UI
Input is not recommended for everyday use of Terraform.

#### Variable Defaults

If no value is assigned to a variable via any of these methods and the variable
has a `default` key in its declaration, that value will be used for the
variable.

### Variable Types

Terraform supports a number of different variable types. The most common ones
are described below, and you can read the (Terraform
documentation)[https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html] for a
complete list.

#### Strings

If no type is specified, then Terraform assumes a variable is a _string_. Like
most programming languages, strings are just a sequence of characters. You can
also explicitly define a variable as a string.

```hcl
variable "project" {
  type = string
}
```

This usually isn't necessary, though, since the string type would otherwise be
assumed.

#### Numbers

A _number_, like a string, is pretty straightforward. Any valid integer or
floating point value is allowed. When processing your configuration, Terraform
will generally do the right thing when converting from a string to a number. So
defining the number type is more about ensure the correct type of input is used.

```hcl
variable "web_instance_count" {
  type    = number
  default = 1
}
```

#### Lists

A list is a sequence of values. Lists are defined either explicitly or
implicitly. For example, add one of the following to `variables.tf`:

```hcl
# Either implicitly by using a default value of empty brackets:
variable "cidrs" { default = [] }

# Or explicitly by specifying the type:
variable "cidrs" { type = list }
```

You can specify list values in a _tfvars_ file as well. Add the following to
`terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
cidrs = [ "10.0.0.0/16", "10.1.0.0/16" ]
```

We'll use these values later on in this guide.

#### Maps

Maps are a way to create variables that are lookup tables. In our configuration,
we've hard-coded the machine type to `f1-micro`. We might want different machine
types for some environments. We can use a map to accomplish this.

Add the following to your `variables.tf` file:

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  type = string
  default = "dev"
}

variable "machine_types" {
  type = "map"
  default = {
    "dev" = "f1-micro"
    "test" = "n1-highcpu-32"
    "prod" = "n1-highcpu-32"
  }
}
```

As with lists, a variable can have a map type assigned explicitly, or it can be
implicitly declared as a map by specifying a default value that is a map.

Now, update your `vm_instance` in `main.tf` as follows:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "terraform-instance"
  machine_type = var.machine_types[var.environment]
  tags         = ["web", "dev"]

# ...
```

The square-bracket index notation used here is how we access values inside a
_map_ type variable.

Run `terraform plan`. Because of the default value we used for `environment`,
you should see that there are no changes to apply.

The `map` type expression can also use a static value lookup directly. For
example: `var.machine_types["dev"]`.

##### Assigning Maps

We set defaults above, but maps can also be set using the `-var` and
`-var-file` values. For example:

```raw
$ terraform apply -var 'machine_types={ "dev" = "f1-micro", test = "n1-standard-16", prod = "n1-standard-16" }'
# ...
```

**Note**: Even if every key will be assigned as input, the variable must be
established as a map in your configuration by setting its type to `map` or its
default to `{}`.

Here is an example of setting a map's keys from a `.tfvars` file. Starting with these
variable definitions:

```hcl
variable "region" {}

variable "machine_types" {
  type = "map"
}
```

You can specify values in your `terraform.tfvars` file:

```hcl
region = "us-central1"

machine_types = {
  "dev" = "f1-micro"
  "test" = "n1-highcpu-32"
  "prod" = "n1-highcpu-32"
}
```

## Outputs

In the previous section, we introduced input variables as a way to parameterize
Terraform configurations. In this page, we'll introduce output variables as a
way to organize data to be easily queried and shown back to the Terraform user.

When building potentially complex infrastructure, Terraform stores hundreds or
thousands of attribute values for all your resources. But as a user of
Terraform, you may only be interested in a few values of importance, such as a
load balancer IP, VPN address, etc.

Outputs are a way to tell Terraform what data is important. This data is
outputted when `apply` is called, and can be queried using the `terraform
output` command.

### Defining Outputs

Let's define an output to show us the static IP address that we created. Edit
the file called `outputs.tf` with the following contents:

```hcl
output "ip" {
  value = google_compute_address.vm_static_ip.address
}
```

**Note**: Just like `variables.tf`, this configuration could go in your `main.tf` file.
We're putting it in a separate file just to keep things organized.

### Output Names

This defines an output variable named "ip". The name of the variable must
conform to Terraform variable naming conventions if it is to be used as an input
to other modules. The `value` field specifies what the value will be, In this
case, we're outputting the `public_ip` attribute of the elastic IP address.

Multiple `output` blocks can be defined to specify multiple output variables.

### Viewing Outputs

Run `terraform refresh` to populate the output. This will refresh your state by
comparing it to your cloud infrastructure. In the process, it will also pick up
the new output. You should see output like this:

```raw
$ terraform refresh
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Refreshing state... [id=orbital-avatar-247819/us-central1/terraform-static-ip]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

Outputs:

ip = 35.192.68.38
```

You'll also see outputs after running `terraform apply`, or you can query the outputs `terraform output`:

```shell
$ terraform output ip
104.154.236.90
```

This command is useful for scripts to extract outputs from your configuration.

## Modules

Up to this point, we've been configuring Terraform by editing Terraform
configurations directly. As our infrastructure grows, this practice has a few
key problems: a lack of organization, a lack of reusability, and difficulties in
management for teams.

_Modules_ in Terraform are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations
that are managed as a group. Modules are used to create reusable components,
improve organization, and to treat pieces of infrastructure as a black box.

This section of the getting started will cover the basics of using modules.
Writing modules is covered in more detail in the [modules
documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html).

### Using Modules

The [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) includes a directory of
ready-to-use modules for various common purposes, which can serve as larger
building-blocks for your infrastructure.

In this example, we're going to use a [network module for
GCP](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/1.1.0),
which will set up a more advanced networking configuration for us.

Add the following to your `main.tf` file:

```hcl
module "network" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/network/google"
  version = "1.1.0"
  depends_on = [google_project_services.project_services]

  network_name = "terraform-vpc-network"
  project_id   = var.project

  subnets = [
    {
      subnet_name   = "subnet-01"
      subnet_ip     = var.cidrs[0]
      subnet_region = var.region
    },
    {
      subnet_name   = "subnet-02"
      subnet_ip     = var.cidrs[1]
      subnet_region = var.region

      subnet_private_access = "true"
    },
  ]

  secondary_ranges = {
    subnet-01 = []
    subnet-02 = []
  }
}
```

The `module` block begins with the name of the module. This is similar to a
`resource` block: it defines a name used within this configuration -- in this
case, `"network"` -- and a set of input values that are listed in [the module's
"Inputs"
documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/1.1.0?tab=inputs).

The `source` attribute is the only mandatory argument for all modules. It tells
Terraform where the module can be retrieved. Terraform will install and manage
modules for you from the Terraform registry, source control systems like GitHub,
a URL, or your local filesystem.

The other attributes shown are inputs to our module. This module supports many
additional inputs, which you can read about in its documentation, but all are
optional and have reasonable defaults.

- *Note*: We used a different name for the new network to avoid errors when
  replacing the old network configuration with the new one.

This will configure a simple network with two subnets. We can replace that
network with the one provisioned by the new module. Comment out or delete the
`vpc_network` resource:

```hcl
# Remove or #comment out:
#
# resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
#   name = "terraform-network"
# }
```

We'll also need to refer to the new network differently. Inside of the
configuration for the `vm_instance`, update the `network_interface` section like
so:

```hcl
# Replace this line:
#   network = google_compute_network.vpc_network.name
# With this these two:
    network    = module.network.network_name
    subnetwork = module.network.subnets_names[0]
```

Now we're referring to the _output_ of the network module. You can see the
output values for modules in the [module registry
documentaton](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/1.1.0?tab=outputs).

Since the instance will now be located in a different network, it will be
destroyed and recreated.

### Initializing Modules

Terraform modules are essentially just pre-packaged Terraform configuration.
They need to be installed on your system before you can use them in your
configuration. You can do that with the _init_ command. Run `terraform init`
now:

```raw
$ terraform init
Initializing modules...
Downloading terraform-google-modules/network/google 1.1.0 for network...
- network in .terraform/modules/network/terraform-google-modules-terraform-google-network-2ada6f9

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "null" (terraform-providers/null) 2.1.2...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.google: version = "~> 2.12"
* provider.null: version = "~> 2.1"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Now the module is installed on your system and Terraform can use it to provision
resources.

If you like, you can run `terraform plan` at this point to see what changes will
be applied. Notice that our instance will be destroyed and recreated because it
will move to a new network.

### Apply Changes

Now run `terraform apply`.

The output is similar to what we saw when using resources directly, but the
resource names now have module paths prefixed to their names:

```raw
$ ./terraform apply
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Refreshing state... [id=capable-stream-249119/us-central1/terraform-static-ip]
module.network.data.google_compute_subnetwork.created_subnets[0]: Refreshing state...
module.network.data.google_compute_subnetwork.created_subnets[1]: Refreshing state...
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  - destroy
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance must be replaced
-/+ resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {

### Module Outputs

Just as the module instance has input arguments, module can also produce
_output_ values, similar to resource attributes. We used two of them when
configuring our instance - the name of the network and one of our subnets.

The module's [output
reference](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/1.1.0?tab=outputs)
describes all of the different values it produces.

One of the supported outputs is called `subnets_ips`, and its value describes
the IPs and CIDR blocks created for our network.

To reference this, we'll just put it into our _own_ output value. This
value could actually be used anywhere: in another resource, to configure
another provider, etc.

Add the following to `outputs.tf`:

```hcl
output "vpc_network_subnets_ips" {
  value = module.network.subnets_ips
}
```

If you run `terraform apply` again, Terraform will make no changes to
infrastructure, but you'll now see the "vpc_network_subnets_ips" output:

```raw
$ terraform apply

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

ip = 35.194.46.141
vpc_network_subnets_ips = [
  "10.0.0.0/16",
  "10.1.0.0/16",
]
```

Infrastructure configuration can be complex and often repetitive. Modules
provide a way to re-use and share standard configuration patterns. In addition
to using modules provided in the module registry, you can also create and share
Terraform modules.

## Remote State

You have now seen how to build, change, and destroy infrastructure from a local
machine. This is great for testing and development, but in production
environments it is considered a best practice to store state elsewhere than your local machine.
The best way to do this is by running Terraform in a remote environment with
shared access to state.

Terraform supports team-based workflows with a feature known as [remote
backends](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html). Remote backends
allow Terraform to use a shared storage space for state data, so any member of
your team can use Terraform to manage the same infrastructure.

Depending on the features you wish to use, Terraform has multiple remote backend
options. HashiCorp recommends using [Terraform
Cloud](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud/tf_cloud_gettingstarted.html).
Terraform Cloud offers free state management with no limits on users,
workspaces, locking, and HashiCorp Vault encryption.

[Terraform
Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=getting-started&utm_campaign=terraform)
is HashiCorp's commercial solution and also acts as a remote backend. Terraform
Enterprise allows teams to easily version, audit, and collaborate on
infrastructure changes. Each proposed change generates a Terraform plan which
can be reviewed and collaborated on as a team. When a proposed change is
accepted, the Terraform logs are stored, resulting in a linear history of
infrastructure states to help with auditing and policy enforcement. Additional
benefits to running Terraform remotely include moving access credentials off of
developer machines and freeing local machines from long-running Terraform
processes.

### How to Store State Remotely

First, we'll use Terraform Cloud as our backend. Terraform Cloud offers free
remote state management. Terraform Cloud is the recommended best practice for
remote state storage.

Terraform Cloud, [view our getting started
guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud/tf_cloud_gettingstarted.html).

When you sign up for Terraform Cloud, you'll create an organization. Make a note
of the organization's name.

Next, configure the backend in your configuration with the organization name,
and a new workspace name of your choice:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    organization = "Example-Org-Name"

    workspaces {
      name = "Example-Workspace"
    }
  }
}
```

You'll also need a user token to authenticate with Terraform Cloud. You can
generate one on the [user settings page](https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens).

Copy the user token to your clipboard, and create a Terraform CLI Configuration
file. This file is This file is located at `%APPDATA%\terraform.rc` on Windows
systems, and `~/.terraformrc` on other systems.

Paste the user token into that file like so:

```hcl
credentials "app.terraform.io" {
  token = "REPLACE_ME"
}
```

Save and close this file, we don't need it again. You can read more about
configuring Terraform Cloud in [the documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/free/index.html).

Now that you've configured your remote backend, run `terraform init` to setup
Terraform. It should ask if you want to migrate your state to Terraform Cloud.

```raw
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "remote" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "remote" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "remote"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value:
```

Say "yes" and Terraform will copy your state:

```raw
...

  Enter a value: yes

Releasing state lock. This may take a few moments...

Successfully configured the backend "remote"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

...
```

Now, if you run `terraform apply`, Terraform should state that there are no
changes:

```raw
$ terraform apply
# ...

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

ip = 104.154.236.90
```

Terraform is now storing your state remotely in Terraform Cloud. Remote state
storage makes collaboration easier and keeps state and secret information off
your local disk. Remote state is loaded only in memory when it is used.

If you want to move back to local state, you can remove the backend
configuration block from your configuration and run `terraform init` again.
Terraform will once again ask if you want to migrate your state back to local.

### Terraform Enterprise

[Terraform
Enterprise](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform/?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=getting-started&utm_campaign=terraform)
is a commercial solution which combines a predictable and reliable shared run
environment with tools to help you work together on Terraform configurations and
modules.

Although Terraform Enterprise can act as a standard remote backend to support
Terraform runs on local machines, it works even better as a remote run
environment. It supports two main workflows for performing Terraform runs:

- A VCS-driven workflow, in which it automatically queues plans whenever changes
  are committed to your configuration's VCS repo.
- An API-driven workflow, in which a CI pipeline or other automated tool can
  upload configurations directly.

For a hands-on introduction to Terraform Enterprise, [follow the Terraform
Enterprise getting started
guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/getting-started/index.html).

## Destroy

As a final step, you will probably want to destroy the infrastructure you
created for this lab, to avoid being charged for it in the future. Do so by
running `terraform destroy`:

```raw
$ terraform destroy
module.network.google_compute_network.network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-vpc-network]
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Refreshing state... [id=capable-stream-249119/us-central1/terraform-static-ip]
module.network.google_compute_subnetwork.subnetwork[1]: Refreshing state... [id=us-central1/subnet-02]
module.network.google_compute_subnetwork.subnetwork[0]: Refreshing state... [id=us-central1/subnet-01]
module.network.data.google_compute_subnetwork.created_subnets[0]: Refreshing state...
module.network.data.google_compute_subnetwork.created_subnets[1]: Refreshing state...
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 5 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

## Next Steps

This concludes the getting started guide for Terraform. Hopefully you're now
able to not only see what Terraform is useful for, but you're also able to put
this knowledge to use to improve building your own infrastructure.

We've covered the basics for all of these features in this guide.

As a next step, the following resources are available:

- [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) - The
  documentation is an in-depth reference guide to all the features of Terraform,
  including technical details about the internals of how Terraform operates.

- [Google Provider
  Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_reference.html)
  The Google provider documentation includes everything you need to configure
  and provision GCP resources.

- [Examples](https://www.terraform.io/intro/examples/index.html) - The examples
  have more full featured configuration files, showing some of the possibilities
  with Terraform.

# Getting Started with Terraform on Google Cloud Platform

## Introduction

### About this guide

This guide will help you quickly learn the fundamentals of Terraform and using
it to provision infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

As you follow this guide, you'll use Terraform to provision, update, and destroy
a simple set of infrastructure using the sample configuration provided.

The sample configuration provisions a resource group, networking resources and
rules, storage, and a basic Linux virtual machine. You'll also learn about
Terraform modules, remote backends, outputs, and provisioners. These are the
building blocks for more complex configurations.

### Google Cloud Shell

This guide uses Google Cloud Shell to give you an environment preconfigured with Terraform. You can run commands at the command prompt, and edit the files in the editor window.

If you'd prefer to follow this tutorial on your local machine, you can follow [this guide on learn.hashicorp.com](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/gcp-get-started).

## Installing Terraform

Terraform is already install in your Cloud Shell environment. You can verify this by running:

```bash
terraform --version
```

If you'd like to install Terraform on your local machine, you can [follow the instructions here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/gcp/install).

### Note: Terraform versions

When running the previous command, you may see a warning that there is a newer version of Terraform available. This guide has been tested with the version of Terraform installed in your Cloud Shell environment, so please continue to use it for the rest of the guide.

## Setting Up

With Terraform installed, let's dive right into it and start creating some
infrastructure.

We'll build infrastructure on [GCP](https://cloud.google.com) for this getting
started guide, but Terraform can manage many other things using
[providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html). Some examples
of this are in the [use cases
section](https://www.terraform.io/intro/use-cases.html).

### Warning: Cost

While everything provisioned in this guide should fall within GCP's free tier, if you provision resources outside of the free tier, you may be charged. We cannot be responsible for any charges you may incur.

### Setting up GCP

In addition to a GCP account, you'll need to use a **GCP Project** to follow
this guide.

Create or select the project you'd like to use throughout this guide below:

<walkthrough-project-billing-setup></walkthrough-project-billing-setup>

This will also set the project ID correctly in future steps, so be sure to
either create or select a project before moving on!

#### Authentication

When you are using Google Cloud Shell, the shell is already configured with
access to your GCP credentials, so you won't need to do anything extra to
authenticate and start provisioning resources. When using Terraform from another
environment, you'll need to configure authentication. You can [read about
credentials
here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_reference.html#credentials).

## Terraform Configuration

The set of files used to describe infrastructure in Terraform is known as a
Terraform _configuration_. We're going to write our first configuration now to
launch a single GCP instance.

The format of the configuration files is [documented
here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html). Configuration
files can [also be
JSON](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/syntax.html), but we recommend
only using JSON when the configuration is generated by a machine.

The entire configuration is shown below. We'll go over each part soon.

When run, Terraform will load all configuration files from the current directory. So it's a good idea to have a separate directory for each project. Your Cloud Shell environment should include a directory called `tutorial` that will store the configuration we'll use for this guide.

Inside of it there should be a file named `main.tf`. Terraform recognizes files ending in `.tf` or `.tf.json` as configuration files and will load them when it runs.

<walkthrough-editor-open-file filePath="terraform-getting-started-gcp-cloud-shell/tutorial/main.tf">main.tf</walkthrough-editor-open-file>

First, we'll configure the provider. Add the following to `main.tf`:

```hcl
provider "google" {
  version = "3.5.0"

  project = "{{project-id}}"
  region  = "us-central1"
  zone    = "us-central1-c"
}
```

Remember you can see a list of your projects in the [cloud resource
manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager)

The `provider` block is used to configure the named provider, in
our case `google`. A provider is responsible for creating and
managing resources. Multiple provider blocks can exist if a
Terraform configuration manages resources from different providers.

### Initialization

The first command to run for a new configuration -- or after checking out an
existing configuration from version control -- is `terraform init`, which
initializes various local settings and data that will be used by subsequent
commands.

Initialize your new Terraform configuration by running the `terraform init`
command in the same directory as your main.tf file.

```bash
terraform init
```

```
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "google" (hashicorp/google) 3.5.0...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

The Google Cloud Platform provider plugin has been downloaded and installed in a
subdirectory of the current working directory.

## Applying Configuration

The `init` command doesn't actually provision any resources, it just sets up
your working directory to use the provider configuration you supplied. Before we can

### Enabling Services

In this guide, we'll be using the Google Compute Engine, and we'll also need to
enable the "OS Login" service for authentication. We need to enable these
services before we can use them. To do so, we'll also introduce our first
_resource_. You can learn more about how this resource works from [the
documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/google_project_services.html).

Add the following to your main.tf file:

```hcl
resource "google_project_service" "service" {
  project  = "{{project-id}}"
  for_each = toset([
    "compute.googleapis.com",
    "oslogin.googleapis.com",
  ])
  service = each.key
}
```

The `resource` block defines a resource that exists within your infrastructure.
A resource might be a physical or virtual component such as a server, or a
logical resource such as a Google App Engine application, or configuration,
which is what this one is. It will enable the listed services for your project.

To apply your changes, run `terraform apply`.

```bash
terraform apply
```

You should see output like this:

```raw
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
Terraform will perform the following actions:
  # google_project_service.service["compute.googleapis.com"] will be created
  + resource "google_project_service" "service" {
      + disable_on_destroy = true
      + id                 = (known after apply)
      + project            = "just-center-247116"
      + service            = "compute.googleapis.com"
    }
  # google_project_service.service["oslogin.googleapis.com"] will be created
  + resource "google_project_service" "service" {
      + disable_on_destroy = true
      + id                 = (known after apply)
      + project            = "just-center-247116"
      + service            = "oslogin.googleapis.com"
    }
Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.


```

Respond with `yes`. When you do, you should see further output like this:

```raw
...
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
  Enter a value: yes
google_project_service.service["oslogin.googleapis.com"]: Creating...
google_project_service.service["compute.googleapis.com"]: Creating...
google_project_service.service["oslogin.googleapis.com"]: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
google_project_service.service["compute.googleapis.com"]: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
google_project_service.service["oslogin.googleapis.com"]: Creation complete after 15s [id=just-center-247116/oslogin.googleapis.com]
google_project_service.service["compute.googleapis.com"]: Creation complete after 15s [id=just-center-247116/compute.googleapis.com]
Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Adding this resource is the equivalent of navigating to the appropriate page in
the [api
library](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/compute.googleapis.com)
and enabling the services there.

You may also have noticed that we have to repeat the project ID. Don't worry, we'll fix that soon when we learn about _variables_.

## Provisioning Resources

Now we'll create our first "real" resource: A Virtual Private Cloud network. Add
the following to your `main.tf` file:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name = "terraform-network"
  depends_on = [google_project_service.service]  
}
```

This is an example of a more common use for resources. We'll use this network
for resources we create later in this guide.

The resource block has two strings before opening the block: the resource type
and the resource name. In our example, the resource type is
"google_compute_network" and the name is "vpc_network." The prefix of the type
maps to the provider. In our case "google_compute_network" automatically tells
Terraform that it is managed by the "google" provider. The resource type and
name together form the resource ID, in this case
"google_compute_network.vpc_network". The resource can be referenced by this ID
in other parts of your configuration.

Within the resource block itself is configuration for that resource. This is
dependent on each resource provider and is fully documented within our
[providers reference](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html).

The [GCP provider](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html)
documents supported resources, including
[google_compute_network](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_network.html).

There are a number of optional arguments, but for our network, we just specify
the name, which will be how the network is identified in GCP.

### Creating Resources

Create the new resources by running `terraform apply` again.

```bash
terraform apply
```

```raw
...
Terraform will perform the following actions:
  # google_compute_network.vpc_network will be created
  + resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
      + auto_create_subnetworks         = true
      + delete_default_routes_on_create = false
      + gateway_ipv4                    = (known after apply)
      + id                              = (known after apply)
      + name                            = "terraform-network"
      + project                         = (known after apply)
      + routing_mode                    = (known after apply)
      + self_link                       = (known after apply)
    }
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
...
```

This output shows the _execution plan_, describing which actions Terraform will
take in order to create infrastructure to match the configuration. The output
format is similar to the diff format generated by tools such as Git. The output
has a `+` next to `resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network"`, meaning
that Terraform will create this resource. Beneath that, it shows the attributes
that will be set. When the value displayed is `(known after apply)`, it means
that the value won't be known until the resource is created.

If the plan was created successfully, Terraform will now pause and wait for
approval before proceeding. If anything in the plan seems incorrect or
dangerous, it is safe to abort here with no changes made to your infrastructure.

In this case the plan looks acceptable, so type `yes` at the confirmation prompt
to proceed.

Executing the plan will take a few minutes since Terraform waits for the network
to be created successfully:

```raw
# ...
  Enter a value: yes
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Creating...
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still creating... [40s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Creation complete after 46s [id=projects/just-center-247116/global/networks/terraform-network]
Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

After this, Terraform is all done! You can go to the GCP console to see the
network you have provisioned. Make sure you're looking at the same region and
project that you configured in the provider configuration.

If you look in your current working directory, you'll see that Terraform also
wrote some data into the `terraform.tfstate` file. This state file is extremely
important; it keeps track of Terraform's understanding of the resources it
created. We recommended that you use source control for the configuration files,
but the state file should not be stored in source control. You can also [setup
Terraform
Cloud](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-gettingstarted/tfc_overview)
to store and share the state with your teams.

## Inspecting State

You can inspect the current state by running `terraform show`.

```bash
terraform show
```

```raw
# google_compute_network.vpc_network:
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
    auto_create_subnetworks         = true
    delete_default_routes_on_create = false
    id                              = "projects/just-center-247116/global/networks/terraform-network"
    name                            = "terraform-network"
    project                         = "just-center-247116"
    routing_mode                    = "REGIONAL"
    self_link                       = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/just-center-247116/global/networks/terraform-network"
}
# google_project_service.service["compute.googleapis.com"]:
resource "google_project_service" "service" {
    disable_on_destroy = true
    id                 = "just-center-247116/compute.googleapis.com"
    project            = "just-center-247116"
    service            = "compute.googleapis.com"
}
# google_project_service.service["oslogin.googleapis.com"]:
resource "google_project_service" "service" {
    disable_on_destroy = true
    id                 = "just-center-247116/oslogin.googleapis.com"
    project            = "just-center-247116"
    service            = "oslogin.googleapis.com"
}
```

You can see that by creating our resource, we've also gathered a lot of
information about it. These values can be referenced to configure other
resources or outputs, which will be covered later in this guide.

## Changing Infrastructure

In the previous section, you created your first infrastructure with Terraform: a
VPC network. In this section, you will modify your configuration and see how
Terraform handles change.

Infrastructure is continuously evolving, and Terraform was built to help manage
and enact that change. As you change Terraform configurations, Terraform builds
an execution plan that only modifies what is necessary to reach your desired
state.

By using Terraform to change infrastructure, you can version control not only
your configurations but also your state, so you can see how the infrastructure
evolves over time.

### Adding Resources

You can add new resources by adding them to your Terraform configuration and
running `terraform apply` to provision them.

First, add a google compute instance resource to `main.tf`.

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "terraform-instance"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"

  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
    }
  }

  network_interface {
    network = google_compute_network.vpc_network.name
    access_config {
    }
  }
}
```

This resource includes a few more arguments. The name and machine type are
simple strings, but `boot_disk` and `network_interface` are more complex blocks.
You can see all of the available options [in the
documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_instance.html).
For this example, your compute instance will use a Debian operating system, and
will be connected to the VPC Network you created earlier. Notice how this
configuration refers to the network's name property with
`google_compute_network.vpc_network.name` --
`google_compute_network.vpc_network` is the ID, matching the values in the block
that defines the network, and `name` is a property of that resource.

The presence of the `access_config` block, even without any arguments, ensures
that the instance will be accessible over the internet.

Next, apply this change to create the compute instance.

```bash
terraform apply
```

```raw
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be created
  + resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
      + can_ip_forward       = false
      + cpu_platform         = (known after apply)
      + deletion_protection  = false
      + guest_accelerator    = (known after apply)
      + id                   = (known after apply)
      + instance_id          = (known after apply)
      + label_fingerprint    = (known after apply)
      + machine_type         = "f1-micro"
      + metadata_fingerprint = (known after apply)
      + name                 = "terraform-instance"
      + project              = (known after apply)
      + self_link            = (known after apply)
      + tags_fingerprint     = (known after apply)
      + zone                 = (known after apply)

      + boot_disk {
          + auto_delete                = true
          + device_name                = (known after apply)
          + disk_encryption_key_sha256 = (known after apply)
          + source                     = (known after apply)

          + initialize_params {
              + image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
              + size  = (known after apply)
              + type  = (known after apply)
            }
        }

      + network_interface {
          + address            = (known after apply)
          + name               = (known after apply)
          + network            = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/hc-training-test/global/networks/terraform-network"
          + network_ip         = (known after apply)
          + subnetwork         = (known after apply)
          + subnetwork_project = (known after apply)

          + access_config {
              + assigned_nat_ip = (known after apply)
              + nat_ip          = (known after apply)
              + network_tier    = (known after apply)
            }
        }

      + scheduling {
          + automatic_restart   = (known after apply)
          + on_host_maintenance = (known after apply)
          + preemptible         = (known after apply)

          + node_affinities {
              + key      = (known after apply)
              + operator = (known after apply)
              + values   = (known after apply)
            }
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Creating...
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still creating... [40s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Creation complete after 41s [id=terraform-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Once again, answer `yes` to the confirmation prompt.

This is a fairly straightforward change - we added a "google_compute_instance"
resource named "vm_instance" to our configuration, and Terraform created the
resource in GCP.

## Changing Resources

Adding new resources is a common task, but changing resource configuration is
another important task that Terraform supports.

Add a "tags" argument to your "vm_instance" so that it looks like this:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "terraform-instance"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"
  tags         = ["web", "dev"]

# ...
```

Run `terraform apply` again to update the instance.

```bash
terraform apply
```

```raw
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

...

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {

...

~ tags                 = [
    + "dev",
    + "web",
  ]

...

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:
```

The prefix `~` means that Terraform will update the resource in-place. You can
go and and apply this change now by responding `yes`, and Terraform will add the
tags to your instance.

## Destructive Changes

A destructive change is a change that requires the provider to replace the
existing resource rather than updating it. This usually happens because the
cloud provider doesn't support updating the resource in the way described by
your configuration.

Changing the disk image of our instance is one example of a destructive change.
Edit the `boot_disk` block inside the `vm_instance` resource in your
configuration file and change it to the following.

```hcl
  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = "cos-cloud/cos-stable"
    }
  }
```

This will change the boot disk from being a Debian 9 image to use Google's
Container-Optimized OS.

Now run `terraform apply` again to see how Terraform will apply this change to
the existing resources.

```bash
terraform apply
```

```raw
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance must be replaced
-/+ resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value:
```

The prefix `-/+` means that Terraform will destroy and recreate the resource,
rather than updating it in-place. While some attributes can be updated in-place
(which are shown with the `~` prefix), changing the boot disk image for an
instance requires recreating it. Terraform and the GCP provider handle these
details for you, and the execution plan makes it clear what Terraform will do.

Additionally, the execution plan shows that the disk image change is what
required our instance to be replaced. Using this information, you can adjust
your changes to possibly avoid destroy/create updates if they are not acceptable
in some situations.

Once again, Terraform prompts for approval of the execution plan before
proceeding. Answer `yes` to execute the planned steps:

```raw
  Enter a value: yes

google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Destroying... [id=terraform-instance]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 10s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 20s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 30s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still destroying... [id=terraform-instance, 40s elapsed]

google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Creation complete after 29s [id=terraform-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
```

As indicated by the execution plan, Terraform first destroyed the existing
instance and then created a new one in its place. You can use `terraform show`
again to see the new values associated with this instance.

## Destroying Infrastructure

You have now seen how to build and change infrastructure. Before moving on to
creating multiple resources and showing resource dependencies, you will see how
to completely destroy your Terraform-managed infrastructure.

Destroying your infrastructure is a rare event in production environments. But
if you're using Terraform to spin up multiple environments such as development,
testing, and staging, then destroying is often a useful action.

### Terraform Destroy

Resources can be destroyed using the `terraform destroy` command, which is
similar to `terraform apply` but it behaves as if all of the resources have been
removed from the configuration.

```bash
terraform destroy
```

```raw
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be destroyed
  - resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
      - can_ip_forward       = false -> null
      - cpu_platform         = "Intel Haswell" -> null
      - deletion_protection  = false -> null
...

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value:
```

The `-` prefix indicates that the instance and the network will be destroyed. As
with apply, Terraform shows its execution plan and waits for approval before
making any changes.

Answer `yes` to execute this plan and destroy the infrastructure:

```raw
Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Destroying... [id=terraform-instance]

google_compute_network.vpc_network: Destroying... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 10s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 20s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 30s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 40s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 50s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 1m0s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Still destroying... [id=terraform-network, 1m10s elapsed]
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Destruction complete after 1m17s

Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
```

Just like with `terraform apply`, Terraform determines the order in which things
must be destroyed. GCP won't allow a VPC network to be deleted if there are
resources still in it, so Terraform waits until the instance is destroyed before
destroying the network. When performing operations, Terraform creates a
dependency graph to determine the correct order of operations. In more
complicated cases with multiple resources, Terraform will perform operations in
parallel when it's safe to do so.

## Resource Dependencies

Most resources work with other parts of your infrastructure, either by being
dependent on other resources to function, such as an instance requiring a
virtual network, or use resource parameters to share information about one
resource with other resources.

Real-world infrastructure has a diverse set of resources and resource types.
Terraform configurations can contain multiple resources, multiple resource
types, and these types can even span multiple providers.

On this page, we'll show a basic example of how to configure multiple resources
and how to use resource attributes to configure other resources.

If you've been following this track, you destroyed your resources in the last
guide, and so `terraform show` will show no resources.

```bash
terraform show
```

 Now recreate your network and instance by running `terraform apply`.

```bash
terraform apply
```

```raw
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be created
  + resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
      + can_ip_forward       = false
...

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
...
Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

It's possible you might see an error like this one:

```raw
Error: Error authoritatively enabling Project PROJECT_ID Services: unable to enable Project Services PROJECT_ID ([oslogin.googl
eapis.com compute.googleapis.com]): Batch "project/PROJECT_ID/services:batchEnable" for request "Enable Project Services PROJECT_ID: [oslogin.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com]" returned error: Error waiting for Enable Project "PROJECT_ID" Services: [oslo
gin.googleapis.com compute.googleapis.com]: Error code 9, message: [The service is currently being deactivated and deactivation must comp
lete before activation can occur.] with failed services [compute.googleapis.com]
```

As the error says, in this case it took a few minutes for the service to be disabled, and the GCP API won't allow us to activate it while this is still going on. If this happens to you, you'll need to wait a few minutes and re-run `terraform apply`.

### Assigning a Static IP Address

Now add to your configuration by assigning a static IP to the VM instance in
`main.tf`.

```hcl
resource "google_compute_address" "vm_static_ip" {
  name = "terraform-static-ip"
}
```

This should look familiar from the earlier example of adding a VM instance
resource, except this time we're creating an "google_compute_address" resource
type. This resource type allocates a [reserved IP
address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/#reservedaddress) to
your project.

You can see what will be created with `terraform plan`:

```bash
terraform plan
```

```raw
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_address.vm_static_ip will be created
  + resource "google_compute_address" "vm_static_ip" {
      + address            = (known after apply)
      + address_type       = "EXTERNAL"
      + creation_timestamp = (known after apply)
      + id                 = (known after apply)
      + name               = "terraform-static-ip"
      + network_tier       = (known after apply)
      + project            = (known after apply)
      + region             = (known after apply)
      + self_link          = (known after apply)
      + subnetwork         = (known after apply)
      + users              = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
```

Unlike `terraform apply`, the _plan_ command will only show what would be
changed, and never actually apply the changes directly. Notice that the only
change you have made so far is to add a static IP. Next, you need to attach the
IP address to your instance.

Update the `network_interface` configuration for your instance like so:

```hcl
  network_interface {
    network = google_compute_network.vpc_network.self_link
    access_config {
      nat_ip = google_compute_address.vm_static_ip.address
    }
  }
```

The
[access_config](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/r/compute_instance.html#access_config)
block has several optional arguments, and in this case we'll set `nat_ip` to be
the static IP address. When Terraform reads this configuration, it will:

1. Ensure that `vm_static_ip` is created before `vm_instance`
1. Save the properties of `vm_static_ip` in the state
1. Set `nat_ip` to the value of the `vm_static_ip.address` property

### Plan Changes

We'll run `terraform plan` again, but this time, let's save the plan:

```bash
terraform plan -out static_ip
```

```raw
Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_address.vm_static_ip will be created
  + resource "google_compute_address" "vm_static_ip" {
      + address            = (known after apply)
      + address_type       = "EXTERNAL"
...

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
        can_ip_forward       = false
        cpu_platform         = "Intel Haswell"
        deletion_protection  = false
...
          ~ access_config {
              ~ nat_ip       = "34.66.211.126" -> (known after apply)
                network_tier = "PREMIUM"
...
Plan: 1 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This plan was saved to: static_ip

To perform exactly these actions, run the following command to apply:
    terraform apply "static_ip"
```

Saving the plan this way ensures that we can apply exactly the same plan in the
future. If we try to apply the file created by the plan, Terraform will first
check to make sure the exact same set of changes will be made before applying
the plan.

In this case, we can see that Terraform will create a new
`google_compute_address` and update the existing VM to use it.

### Apply Changes

Run `terraform apply "static_ip"` to see how Terraform plans to apply this change.
The output will look similar to the following:

```bash
terraform apply "static_ip"
```

```raw
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Creating...
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Creation complete after 5s [id=hc-training-test/us-central1/terraform-static-ip]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Modifying... [id=terraform-instance]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still modifying... [id=terraform-instance, 10s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Still modifying... [id=terraform-instance, 20s elapsed]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Modifications complete after 28s [id=terraform-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed.

The state of your infrastructure has been saved to the path
below. This state is required to modify and destroy your
infrastructure, so keep it safe. To inspect the complete state
use the `terraform show` command.

State path: terraform.tfstate
```

As shown above, Terraform created the static IP before modifying the VM
instance. Due to the interpolation expression that passes the IP address to the
instance's network interface configuration, Terraform is able to infer a
dependency, and knows it must create the static IP before updating the instance.

## Implicit and Explicit Dependencies

By studying the resource attributes used in interpolation expressions, Terraform
can automatically infer when one resource depends on another. In the example
above, the reference to `google_compute_address.vm_static_ip.address` creates an
_implicit dependency_ on the `google_compute_address` named `vm_static_ip`.

Terraform uses this dependency information to determine the correct order in
which to create and update different resources. In the example above, Terraform
knows that the `vm_static_ip` must be created before the `vm_instance` is
updated to use it.

Implicit dependencies via interpolation expressions are the primary way
to inform Terraform about these relationships, and should be used whenever
possible.

Sometimes there are dependencies between resources that are not visible to
Terraform. The `depends_on` argument can be added to any resource and accepts a
list of resources to create explicit dependencies for.

For example, when we created the vpc_network, we added an explicit dependency on the project services we enabled:

```hcl
resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
  name = "terraform-network"
  depends_on = [google_project_services.project_services]  
}
```

This dependency ensures that the network will be created only after the project
services are enabled, and that the project services won't be disabled until
after the network is destroyed. There isn't an implicit dependency on these two
resources, since there's no direct connection in the GCP API between the network
on the services we enabled.

## Provisioning

The compute instance we launched at this point is based on the Google image
given, but has no additional software installed or configuration applied.

GCP allows customers to manage their own [custom operating system images
](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/create-delete-deprecate-private-images).
This can be a great way to ensure the instances you provision with Terraform are
pre-configured based on your needs. [Packer](https://www.packer.io) is the
perfect tool for this and includes a [builder for
GCP](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/googlecompute.html).

In general, we recommend that you use a tool like Packer so that your
infrastructure requires little or no provisioning after it's deployed. Managing
your infrastructure this way is sometimes called _immutable infrastructure_, and
can help ensure your infrastructure is more robust and fault tolerant.

That said, many infrastructures still require some sort of initialization or
software provisioning step. Terraform uses _provisioners_ to upload files, run
shell scripts, or install and trigger other software like configuration
management tools.

### Defining a Provisioner

To define a provisioner, modify the resource block defining the first
`vm_instance` in your configuration to look like the following.

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "terraform-instance"
  machine_type = "f1-micro"
  tags         = ["web", "dev"]

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${google_compute_instance.vm_instance.name}:  ${google_compute_instance.vm_instance.network_interface[0].access_config[0].nat_ip} >> ip_address.txt"
  }

# ...
```

This adds a `provisioner` block within the `resource` block. Multiple
`provisioner` blocks can be added to define multiple provisioning steps.
Terraform supports [many
provisioners](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html), but for
this example we are using the `local-exec` provisioner.

The `local-exec` provisioner executes a command locally on the machine running
Terraform, not the VM instance itself. We're using this provisioner versus the
others so we don't have to worry about specifying any [connection
info](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/connection.html) right now.

This also shows a more complex example of string interpolation than we've seen
before. Each VM instance can have multiple network interfaces, so we refer to
the first one with `network_interface[0]` - counting starting from 0, as most
programming languages do. Each network interface can have multiple access_config
blocks as well, so once again we specify the first one.

### Running Provisioners

The results of running `terraform apply` at this point may be confusing at
first:

```bash
terraform apply
```

```raw
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Refreshing state... [id=hc-training-test/us-central1/terraform-static-ip]
google_compute_instance.another_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance-2]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

Terraform found nothing to do - and if you check, you'll find that there's no
`ip_address.txt` file on the cloud shell filesystem.

Terraform treats provisioners differently from other module arguments.
Provisioners only run when a resource is created, but adding a provisioner does
not force that resource to be destroyed and recreated. Use `terraform taint` to
tell Terraform to recreate the instance.

```bash
terraform taint google_compute_instance.vm_instance
```

```raw
Resource instance google_compute_instance.vm_instance has been marked as tainted.
```

A _tainted_ resource will be destroyed and recreated during the next _apply_.
Run `terraform apply` now:

```bash
terraform apply
```

```raw
# ...

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance is tainted, so must be replaced
-/+ resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {

# ...

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

# ...

google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Provisioning with 'local-exec'...
google_compute_instance.vm_instance (local-exec): Executing: ["/bin/sh" "-c" "echo 104.154.236.90 > ip_address.txt"]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Creation complete after 52s [id=terraform-instance]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
```

Verify everything worked by looking at the contents of the `ip_address.txt`
file.

```bash
cat ip_address.txt
```

```raw
terraform-instance: 35.194.46.141
```

It contains the IP address, just as we asked.

### Failed Provisioners and Tainted Resources

If a resource is successfully created but fails a provisioning step, Terraform
will error and mark the resource as _tainted_. A resource that is tainted still
exists, but shouldn't be considered safe to use, since provisioning failed.

When you generate your next execution plan, Terraform will remove any tainted
resources and create new resources, attempting to provision them again after
creation.

### Destroy Provisioners

Provisioners can also be defined that run only during a destroy
operation. These are useful for performing system cleanup, extracting
data, etc.

For many resources, using built-in cleanup mechanisms is recommended
if possible (such as init scripts), but provisioners can be used if
necessary.

The getting started guide won't show any destroy provisioner examples.
If you need to use destroy provisioners, please
[see the provisioner documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners).

## Variables

You now have enough Terraform knowledge to create useful configurations, but the
configuration still hardcodes the project name, zone, and other arguments. To
become truly shareable and version controlled, we need to parameterize the
configurations. This page introduces input variables as a way to do this.

### Defining Variables

First, convert a few of the hardcoded values into variables.

Edit the file called `variables.tf` to add the following contents.

```hcl
variable "project" { }

variable "region" {
  default = "us-central1"
}

variable "zone" {
  default = "us-central1-c"
}
```

#### Note

Terraform loads all files ending in `.tf` in a directory, so it doesn't matter
to terraform where your variables are defined. We recommend defining them in
their own file to make your configuration easier to organize and understand.

This file defines three variables within your Terraform configuration. The first
one has an empty block: `{ }`. The other two set defaults. If a default value is
set, the variable is optional. Otherwise, the variable is required. If you run
`terraform plan` now, Terraform will prompt you for the values for `project` and
`credentials_file`.

### Using Variables in Configuration

Next, update the GCP provider configuration in `main.tf` to use these new
variables.

```hcl
provider "google" {
  version = "3.5.0"

  project = var.project
  region  = var.region
  zone    = var.zone
}
```

Variables are referenced with the `var.` prefix.

### Assigning Variables

There are several ways to assign variables, depending on your needs.

#### Command-line flags

You can set variables directly on the command-line with the `-var` flag. Any
command in Terraform that inspects the configuration accepts this flag, such as
`apply`, `plan`, and `refresh`:

```bash
terraform plan -var 'project={{project-id}}'
```

Setting variables this way will not save them, and they'll have to be passed
this way every time you run terraform.

#### From a file

To persist variable values, create a file and assign variables within
this file. Edit the file named `terraform.tfvars` with the following
contents.

```hcl
project = "{{project-id}}"
```

Terraform automatically loads all files which match `terraform.tfvars` or
`*.auto.tfvars` present in the current directory to populate variables. You can
also specify a file to load with the `-var-file` commandline argument.

These files are the same syntax as Terraform configuration files.

For security reasons, we recommend never saving usernames, passwords, and secret
keys to version control. Your terraform configuration will probably need these
secret values, though. One solution is to create a local secret variables file
and use `-var-file` to load it.

You can also use multiple `-var-file` arguments in a single command, with some
checked in to version control and others not checked in. For example:

```raw
terraform apply \
  -var-file="secret.tfvars" \
  -var-file="production.tfvars"
```

#### From environment variables

Terraform will read environment variables in the form of `TF_VAR_name` to find
the value for a variable. For example, in this configuration the `TF_VAR_region`
environment variable could be used to set the `region` terraform variable.

#### UI Input

If you execute `terraform apply` with some variables unspecified, Terraform will
ask you to input their values interactively. These values are not saved, but
this provides a convenient workflow when getting started with Terraform. UI
Input is not recommended for everyday use of Terraform.

#### Variable Defaults

If no value is assigned to a variable via any of these methods and the variable
has a `default` key in its declaration, that value will be used for the
variable.

### Variable Types

Terraform supports a number of different variable types. The most common ones
are described below, and you can read the (Terraform
documentation)[https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html] for a
complete list.

#### Strings

If no type is specified, then Terraform assumes a variable is a _string_. Like
most programming languages, strings are just a sequence of characters. You can
also explicitly define a variable as a string.

Set the type of the `project` variable to be a string by updating
`variables.tf`.

```hcl
variable "project" {
  type = string
}
```

This usually isn't necessary, though, since the string type would otherwise be
assumed.

#### Numbers

A _number_, like a string, is pretty straightforward. Any valid integer or
floating point value is allowed. When processing your configuration, Terraform
will generally do the right thing when converting from a string to a number. So
defining the number type is more about ensure the correct type of input is used.

```hcl
variable "web_instance_count" {
  type    = number
  default = 1
}
```

#### Lists

Like lists or arrays found in many programming languages, a list is a sequence
of values.

Add a variable to `variables.tf` to define the CIDR network blocks to your
configuration as a list by either setting the default to a list, or setting the
type to `list`.

```hcl
variable "cidrs" { type = list }
```

You can specify list values in a _tfvars_ file as well. Add the following to
`terraform.tfvars`.

```hcl
cidrs = [ "10.0.0.0/16", "10.1.0.0/16" ]
```

We'll use these values later on in this guide.

#### Maps

Maps are a way to create variables that are lookup tables. Terraform maps are
similar to data structures found in programming languages, sometimes referred to
as maps or dictionaries.


In your configuration, the machine type is currently set to `f1-micro`. You
might want different machine types for different environments. You can use a map
to accomplish this.

Add a map that defines the machine types for each environment to your
`variables.tf` file.

```hcl
variable "environment" {
  type    = string
  default = "dev"
}

variable "machine_types" {
  type    = map
  default = {
    dev  = "f1-micro"
    test = "n1-highcpu-32"
    prod = "n1-highcpu-32"
  }
}
```

As with lists, a variable can have a map type assigned explicitly, or it can be
implicitly declared as a map by specifying a default value that is a map.

Use the `machine_types` map to set the machine type for the first `vm_instance`
in `main.tf`.

```hcl
resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
  name         = "terraform-instance"
  machine_type = var.machine_types[var.environment]
  tags         = ["web", "dev"]

# ...
```

The square-bracket index notation used here is how we access values inside a
_map_ type variable.

Run `terraform plan`. Because of the default value we used for `environment`,
you should see that there are no changes to apply.

Maps can also use a static value lookup directly. For example:
`var.machine_types["dev"]` will resolve to `"f1-micro"`.

##### Assigning Maps

We set defaults above, but maps can also be set using the `-var` and
`-var-file` values. For example:

```bash
 terraform apply -var 'machine_types={ dev = "f1-micro", test = "n1-standard-16", prod = "n1-standard-16" }'
 ```

**Note**: Even if every key will be assigned as input, the variable must be
established as a map in your configuration by setting its type to `map` or its
default to `{}`.


You can also set a map's keys from a `.tfvars` file after it is defined as a
map.

Starting with these variable definitions in `variables.tf`.

```hcl
variable "region" {
  type    = string
  default = "us-central1"
}

variable "machine_types" {
  type    = map
  default = {
    dev  = "f1-micro"
    test = "n1-highcpu-32"
    prod = "n1-highcpu-32"
  }
}
```

Specify values in your `terraform.tfvars` file.

```hcl
region = "us-central1"

machine_types = {
  dev  = "f1-micro"
  test = "n1-highcpu-32"
  prod = "n1-highcpu-32"
}
```

Once again, running `terraform apply` at this point will have no effect, because
the value `"f1-micro"` from the map is the same as the hard coded value used
originally.

## Outputs

In the previous guide, we introduced input variables as a way to parameterize
Terraform configurations. In this guide, we'll introduce output variables as a
way to organize data to be easily queried and shown back to the Terraform user.

When building complex infrastructure, Terraform stores hundreds or thousands of
attribute values for all your resources. But as a user of Terraform, you may
only be interested in a few values of importance, such as a load balancer IP,
VPN address, etc.

Outputs are a way to tell Terraform what data is important. This data is
outputted when `apply` is called, and can be queried using the `terraform
output` command.

### Defining Outputs

Let's define an output to show us the static IP address that we created. Edit
the file called `outputs.tf` with the following contents.

```hcl
output "ip" {
  value = google_compute_address.vm_static_ip.address
}
```

**Note**: Just like `variables.tf`, this configuration could go in your `main.tf` file.
  `main.tf` file. We recommend putting outputs and variables in a separate files
  to to keep things organized.

### Output Names

This defines an output variable named "ip". The name of the variable must
conform to Terraform variable naming conventions if it is to be used as an input
to other modules. The `value` field specifies what the value will be, In this
case, we're outputting the `public_ip` attribute of the elastic IP address.

Multiple `output` blocks can be defined to specify multiple output variables.

### Viewing Outputs

Run `terraform refresh` to populate the output. This will refresh your state by
comparing it to your cloud infrastructure. In the process, it will also pick up
the new output. You should see output like this:

```bash
terraform refresh
```

```raw
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Refreshing state... [id=orbital-avatar-247819/us-central1/terraform-static-ip]
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

Outputs:

ip = 35.192.68.38
```

You will also see outputs after running `terraform apply`, or you can query the
outputs with `terraform output`.

```bash
terraform output
```

```raw
ip = 104.154.236.90
```

```bash
terraform output ip
```

```raw
104.154.236.90
```

This command is useful for scripts to extract outputs from your configuration.

## Modules

Up to this point, you have been configuring Terraform by editing Terraform
configurations directly. As your infrastructure grows, this practice has a few
key problems: a lack of organization, a lack of reusability, and difficulties in
management for teams.

_Modules_ in Terraform are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations
that are managed as a group. Modules are used to create reusable components,
improve organization, and to treat pieces of infrastructure as a black box.

This section of the getting started will cover the basics of using modules.
Writing modules is covered in more detail in the [modules
documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html).

### Using Modules

The [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) includes a directory of
ready-to-use modules for various common purposes, which can serve as larger
building-blocks for your infrastructure.

In this example, we're going to use a [network module for
GCP](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/1.1.0),
which will set up a more advanced networking configuration for us.

Use a module to define a network by adding the following to your `main.tf` file.

```hcl
module "network" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/network/google"
  version = "2.0.2"
  depends_on = [google_project_services.project_services]

  network_name = "terraform-vpc-network"
  project_id   = var.project

  subnets = [
    {
      subnet_name   = "subnet-01"
      subnet_ip     = var.cidrs[0]
      subnet_region = var.region
    },
    {
      subnet_name   = "subnet-02"
      subnet_ip     = var.cidrs[1]
      subnet_region = var.region

      subnet_private_access = "true"
    },
  ]

  secondary_ranges = {
    subnet-01 = []
    subnet-02 = []
  }
}
```

The `module` block begins with the name of the module. This is similar to a
`resource` block: it defines a name used within this configuration -- in this
case, `"network"` -- and a set of input values that are listed in [the module's
"Inputs"
documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/1.1.0?tab=inputs).

The `source` attribute is the only mandatory argument for all modules. It tells
Terraform where the module can be retrieved. Terraform will install and manage
modules for you from the Terraform registry, source control systems like GitHub,
a URL, or your local filesystem.

The other attributes shown are inputs to our module. This module supports many
additional inputs, which you can read about in its documentation, but all are
optional and have reasonable defaults.

- *Note*: We used a different name for the new network to avoid errors when
  replacing the old network configuration with the new one.

This will configure a simple network with two subnets. We can replace that
network with the one provisioned by the new module. Comment out or delete the
`vpc_network` resource:

```hcl
# Remove or #comment out:
#
# resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
#   name = "terraform-network"
# }
```

 You will also need to refer to the new network differently. Inside of the
 configuration for the `vm_instance`, update the `network_interface` section
 like so:

```hcl
# Replace this line:
#   network = google_compute_network.vpc_network.name
# With this these two:
    network    = module.network.network_name
    subnetwork = module.network.subnets_names[0]
```


Now your configuration is referring to the _output_ of the network module. You
can see the output values for modules in the [module registry
documentaton](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/1.1.0?tab=outputs).

Since the instance will now be located in a different network, it will be
destroyed and recreated.

### Initializing Modules

Terraform modules are essentially just pre-packaged Terraform configuration.
They need to be installed on your system before you can use them in your
configuration. You can do that with the _init_ command.

Install the network module by running `terraform init` now.

```bash
terraform init
```

```raw
Initializing modules...
Downloading terraform-google-modules/network/google 1.1.0 for network...
- network in .terraform/modules/network/terraform-google-modules-terraform-google-network-2ada6f9

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Checking for available provider plugins...
- Downloading plugin for provider "null" (terraform-providers/null) 2.1.2...

The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
so the latest version was installed.

To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
changes, it is recommended to add version = "..." constraints to the
corresponding provider blocks in configuration, with the constraint strings
suggested below.

* provider.google: version = "~> 2.12"
* provider.null: version = "~> 2.1"

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Now the module is installed on your system and Terraform can use it to provision
resources. You need to run `terraform init` or `terraform get` every time you
add a new module or want to change module versions.

If you like, you can run `terraform plan` at this point to see what changes will
be applied. Notice that your instance will be destroyed and recreated because it
will move to the new network.

### Apply Changes

Now run `terraform apply`.

The output is similar to what we saw when using resources directly, but the
resources now have the module name prefixed to their names.

```bash
terraform apply
```

```raw
google_compute_network.vpc_network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-network]
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Refreshing state... [id=capable-stream-249119/us-central1/terraform-static-ip]
module.network.data.google_compute_subnetwork.created_subnets[0]: Refreshing state...
module.network.data.google_compute_subnetwork.created_subnets[1]: Refreshing state...
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
  - destroy
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance must be replaced

### Module Outputs

Just as the module instance has input arguments, module can also produce
_output_ values, similar to resource attributes. We used two of them when
configuring our instance - the name of the network and one of our subnets.

The module's [output
reference](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/network/google/1.1.0?tab=outputs)
describes all of the different values it produces.

One of the supported outputs is called `subnets_ips`, and its value describes
the IPs and CIDR blocks created for our network.

You can reference a module's output with the expression `module.<MODULE
NAME>.<OUTPUT NAME>`. Like most expressions, this value can be used almost
anywhere: in another resource, to configure another module, etc. To demonstrate,
try referencing it in a root-level output, so Terraform displays it after an
apply.

Add an output for the VPC's subnet IP addresses to `outputs.tf`.

```hcl
output "vpc_network_subnets_ips" {
  value = module.network.subnets_ips
}
```

If you run `terraform apply` again, Terraform will make no changes to
infrastructure, but you'll now see the "vpc_network_subnets_ips" output.

```bash
terraform apply
```

```raw
Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

ip = 35.194.46.141
vpc_network_subnets_ips = [
  "10.0.0.0/16",
  "10.1.0.0/16",
]
```

Infrastructure configuration can be complex and often repetitive. Modules
provide a way to re-use and share standard configuration patterns.

## Destroy

As a final step, you will probably want to destroy the infrastructure you
created for this lab, to avoid being charged for it in the future. Do so by
running `terraform destroy`:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

```raw
module.network.google_compute_network.network: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-vpc-network]
google_compute_address.vm_static_ip: Refreshing state... [id=capable-stream-249119/us-central1/terraform-static-ip]
module.network.google_compute_subnetwork.subnetwork[1]: Refreshing state... [id=us-central1/subnet-02]
module.network.google_compute_subnetwork.subnetwork[0]: Refreshing state... [id=us-central1/subnet-01]
module.network.data.google_compute_subnetwork.created_subnets[0]: Refreshing state...
module.network.data.google_compute_subnetwork.created_subnets[1]: Refreshing state...
google_compute_instance.vm_instance: Refreshing state... [id=terraform-instance]

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 5 to destroy.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

After you respond to the prompt with `yes`, Terraform will remove all of the
infrastructure managed by your configuration.

## Next Steps

This concludes the getting started guide for Terraform. Hopefully you're now
able to not only see what Terraform is useful for, but you're also able to put
this knowledge to use to improve building your own infrastructure.

We've covered the basics for all of these features in this guide.

As a next step, the following resources are available:

- [Terraform Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) - The
  documentation is an in-depth reference guide to all the features of Terraform,
  including technical details about the internals of how Terraform operates.

- [Google Provider
  Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/provider_reference.html)
  The Google provider documentation includes everything you need to configure
  and provision GCP resources.

- [Examples](https://www.terraform.io/intro/examples/index.html) - The examples
  have more full featured configuration files, showing some of the possibilities
  with Terraform.

- [Terraform Cloud](/terraform/cloud-gettingstarted/tfc_overview) - Terraform
  Cloud is a hosted application that can be used to store Terraform state and
  execute Terraform commands.
